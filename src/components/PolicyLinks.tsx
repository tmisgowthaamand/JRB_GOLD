Fair, Transparent, and Customer-Centric

At JRB Gold Pvt Limited, we strive to deliver genuine, high-quality gold and silver jewelry with complete transparency.

Custom/Personalized Jewelry:
• Orders for engraved, made-to-order, or specially customized items cannot be cancelled once production begins.

Wholesale Orders:
• Cancellations for bulk or trade orders are subject to the agreed purchase contract. Any cancellation after procurement or production has begun may incur a restocking or processing fee.

You must report the issue within 48 hours of delivery.

On verification, we will provide one of the following:
