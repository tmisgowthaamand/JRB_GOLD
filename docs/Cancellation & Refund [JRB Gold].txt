Cancellation & Refund Policy

Fair, Transparent, and Customer-Centric

At JRB Gold Pvt Limited, we strive to deliver genuine, high-quality gold and silver jewelry with complete transparency. While we work hard to ensure every order meets your expectations, we recognize that occasional issues may arise. This policy outlines how cancellations, returns, and refunds are handled for retail and wholesale customers.

Order Cancellations

Retail Orders:

Cancellations must be requested within 2 hours of order placement.

Once an order is processed, packed, or dispatched, cancellations are not possible.

Custom/Personalized Jewelry:

Orders for engraved, made-to-order, or specially customized items cannot be cancelled once production begins.

Wholesale Orders:

Cancellations for bulk or trade orders are subject to the agreed purchase contract. Any cancellation after procurement or production has begun may incur a restocking or processing fee.

To request cancellation, contact us via phone or email with your Order ID and details.

Returns & Exchanges

We maintain strict quality checks before dispatch. However, if you receive:

A damaged product

A wrong item or incorrect order fulfillment

A manufacturing defect

You must report the issue within 48 hours of delivery.

On verification, we will provide one of the following:

Replacement of the same product

Exchange with another item of equal value

Refund (where replacement is not possible)

Note: Minor variations in weight, finish, or design (common with handcrafted jewelry) are not considered defects.

Non-Returnable Items

We cannot accept returns or refunds for:

Custom-made, engraved, or personalized jewelry

Items damaged due to improper handling after delivery

Products returned without prior authorization

Orders where tamper-proof packaging is broken or missing

Refund Process

Once a refund is approved, it will be initiated within 3–5 business days.

Refunds are processed via the original payment method (card, UPI, bank transfer).

Refund timelines depend on your bank/payment provider (usually 5–10 business days).

For wholesale/export clients, refunds may be adjusted as credit notes for future orders, based on contractual terms.

Exceptions

Refunds or cancellations will not apply in the following cases:

Delays caused by courier/logistics partners beyond our control

Daily fluctuations in gold/silver market rates affecting price differences

Change of mind after dispatch or acceptance of delivery
